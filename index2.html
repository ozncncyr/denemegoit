      <h1>Planet Fatness</h1>

      <p>
        Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to
        start - people said. Nonsense! - I thought. To me, a 19-year-old guy,
        overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress,
        those healthy-life-gurus sounded like aliens coming from another planet.
        On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my planet, eating pizza
        was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost
        100 pounds and completely changed my diet, I still believe we WERE on
        different planets. The thing is that once I escaped.

        Now I'm a coach with 7+ years of experience who founded the chain of
        sport clubs each having a fitness bar and assistance of psychologists,
        and dietitians. I'm sure that nothing will work until you know where you
        are and where you go. Possibly, you are now on the planet Fatness and
        want to escape it. Here I am to show you the way out. The gym itself is
        the spacecraft for you to reach a happy new life, with its fitness bars
        to adapt your body to new conditions and with friendly crew to motivate
        you and help on your way.
